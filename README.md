AMMI-Stability-Research
=======================

The purpose of this project is study the reliability of different AMMI stability indicies in the G by E literature. Of particular interest is comparing the ASV index to the nonparametric rank index from Huehn (1990).

Most of the papers using AMMI stability measures use a set of real data, and compare different stability measures.
The main output is a table with all of the cross-correlations between stability rankings.

However, I have not yet seen a paper that compares the performance of stability measures using simulated data.
